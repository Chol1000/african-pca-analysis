# African Economic Development PCA Analysis

## Overview
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) implementation from scratch using NumPy on African economic development data.

## Dataset Features
14 African economic indicators including GDP Growth Rate, Inflation Rate, Unemployment Rate, Foreign Direct Investment, Government Debt to GDP, Trade Balance, Remittances to GDP, Agriculture Contribution, Industry Contribution, Services Contribution, Life Expectancy, Literacy Rate, Internet Penetration, and Energy Consumption.

## Key Results
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: 14 â†’ 3 features (78.6% reduction)
- **Variance Preservation**: 100% variance retained with 3 components
- **Principal Components**: PC1 (42.97%), PC2 (38.57%), PC3 (18.46%)

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chol1000/african-pca-analysis.git
cd african-pca-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Open `african_pca_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and run all cells.

## Implementation
- Pure NumPy PCA from scratch
- Dynamic component selection (95% variance threshold)
- African economic dataset (not generic data)
- Comprehensive visualizations
